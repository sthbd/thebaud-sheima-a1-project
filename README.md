Assignment 1 

Hello, this is a mini short horror-ish story about symptoms of sleep deprivation. As someone who used to be sleep deprived (and still is from time to time), I wanted to tell a short story while emphasizing how crucial it is to get some sleep. It affects our ability to think, function, socialize, and most importantly, our health. I have decided to include the following symptoms: Nosebleeds, Hallucinations (Visual, Sound), Irritability, Forgetfulness. I think a lot of students might relate to this, as sometimes we lose sleep because of homework. 

Enjoy!
